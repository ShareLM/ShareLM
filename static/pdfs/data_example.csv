362,8b41d920-2698-45b7-ef0a-752d1f7ab617,"[""The sun appears yellow to us because of the way that our atmosphere scatters light. The sun itself is actually white, and it emits light at all visible waves lengths, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. However, when the sun's light travels through the Earth's atmosphere, the shorter wavelengths of light (such as blue and violet) are scattered in all directions more than the longer wavelengths (such as red, orange, and yellow). This is known as Rayleigh scattering.\nAs a result, the blue and violet light is scattered in all directions, and some of it is scattered up into our line of sight, which makes the sky appear blue. The yellow, orange, and red light, which is scattered less, continues on its path towards the Earth's surface. When the sun is high in the sky, the yellow, orange, and red light is able to reach us relatively unimpeded, and the sun appears white. However, when the sun is lower in the sky, such as at sunrise or sunset, the light has to pass through more of the Earth's atmosphere, and more of the shorter wavelengths are scattered out\n""]","[""Why is the sun yellow\n""]",https://tomoniai-mixtral-chat.hf.space/?__theme=light,b8255a02-ea02-4611-df20-f7bd4160b7e0,"{""age"":""32"",""gender"":""Man"",""location"":""Israel""}",2024-01-25T20:13:43.141Z,{}
